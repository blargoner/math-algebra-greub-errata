\section*{Introduction}
This document contains errata from \cite{greub1} and~\cite{greub2}. Locations within each text are indicated by coordinates~\((p,n)\), where \(p\)~is a page number and \(n\)~is a line number on page~\(p\). Positive line numbers count from the top of the page, whereas negative line numbers count from the bottom of the page. Displayed equations, diagrams, and figures are counted as single lines.
