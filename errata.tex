\section*{Introduction}
This document contains errata from~\cite{greub}. Locations in the text are indicated by coordinates~\((p,n)\), where \(p\)~is a page number and \(n\)~is a line number on page~\(p\). Positive line numbers count from the top of the page, whereas negative line numbers count from the bottom of the page. Displayed equations, diagrams, and figures are counted as single lines.

Minor, purely typographical inconsistencies like those between ``\(1\ldots n\)'' and ``\(1,\ldots,n\)'', or between ``family \(x_{\alpha}\)'' and ``family \((x_{\alpha})\)'' and ``family \(\{x_{\alpha}\}\)'', are not listed but occur frequently.

Errata are currently only listed for Chapters 0--VI (except \S~3 of Chapter~VI).
